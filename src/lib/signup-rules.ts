/**
 * What makes a good signup, said once. The Magic Compose system prompt
 * (`magic-compose/prompt.ts`) interpolates these, and a test on each side
 * checks that every entry of `RULES_IN_BOTH` is present word for word, so the
 * two cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The prompt is tuned against evals and pinned by a golden file: changing a
 * character here changes what the model reads. Template literals throughout,
 * so prettier cannot swap the quotes inside them. Keep `{{TODAY}}` out of
 * this file: the prompt renderer replaces only the first one it finds.
